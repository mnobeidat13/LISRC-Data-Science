first lesson

review the syllabus

start with guessing game
explain that data science and machine learning is all about pattern recognition
talk a little about types of data and what patterns can be found in them
explain that all data is numbers at the end, at least for the machine
eplain in detail what patterns can be found in all types of data and give axamples on tabular, text, images, and audio

explain what is probability and distributions
coin and dice example
then build up to how machine learning is trying the predict the probability of the target variable Y given the input X

explain the basic stats like mean std mode and variance and how they are the most basic patterns you can find in any data set and they are general prediction about the data calculated given the input

how does a machine learn? you expose it to past experience and it extraxts patterns from that experience

talk about all types of machine learning
supervised:  machine learning where an algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions
and finds a relationship between the input variables and the target variable
training data , input features, target vairable
examples:
image classifications
spam email detection
predicting house prices

unsupervised :Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the
algorithm is trained on a dataset without explicit supervision in the form
of labeled output data. In unsupervised learning, the goal is typically to
find patterns, structures, or relationships within the input data itself

it give a general understanding of the relationship between the input variables
its does not priduce labels that gien an input the output will be a specfic value
but it says that the input has similar features to othe data points in the same group

types of prblems you solve with unsupervised learning:
Clustering
Dimensionality Reduction
Anomaly Detection
Topic Modeling

examples:
1. K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation:

Imagine you work for a retail company, and you have a dataset of customer purchase histories. Each row in the dataset represents a customer, and the columns represent various features such as:

Total amount spent
Number of items purchased
Frequency of visits to the store
Average purchase amount
etc.
The goal is to segment these customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior without any predefined categories or labels.

2. Document Clustering for Topic Modeling:

Imagine you have a large collection of text documents, such as news articles or customer reviews,
and you want to uncover the underlying topics present in the text data.
This is a common application of unsupervised learning,
particularly Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

3. Credit Card Fraud Detection:

In the financial industry, credit card fraud is a significant concern.
Unsupervised learning techniques can be employed to identify fraudulent
transactions without the need for labeled examples of fraud.


Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm
that combines elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning.
In semi-supervised learning, a model is trained on a dataset
that contains both labeled and unlabeled examples.
This approach is particularly useful in situations
where obtaining a fully labeled dataset is costly or time-consuming,
but there is some limited labeled data available.

train a supervised model in the labeld data
make prediction for the unlabeld data
take the most confident predictions
add them to labeled dataset
train the model again on the new set
and repeat



##
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions to maximize a cumulative reward signal over time. It is a powerful approach used in various applications, including robotics, game playing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. Here are the key components and concepts of reinforcement learning:

Agent: The agent is the learner or decision-maker that interacts with the environment. It takes actions based on its current state and seeks to maximize its long-term reward.

Environment: The environment is the external system or process with which the agent interacts. It is the context in which the agent operates and where it receives feedback in the form of rewards.

State (S): The state represents the current situation or configuration of the environment, which the agent observes. The state is essential for the agent to make informed decisions.

Action (A): Actions are the choices or decisions that the agent can take at each time step. The set of possible actions depends on the specific problem.

Policy (Ï€): The poli/cy is a strategy that defines the agent's behavior, specifying which action to take in a given state. The goal of RL is often to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward.

Reward (R): The reward is a scalar signal that the agent receives from the environment after taking an action in a particular state. It indicates the immediate benefit or cost of the action.

Cumulative Reward (Return): The cumulative reward, also known as the return, is the sum of rewards obtained by the agent over a sequence of time steps. The agent aims to maximize the expected cumulative reward.

Value Function (V): The value function estimates the expected cumulative reward that an agent can obtain starting from a particular state and following a policy. It helps the agent make decisions by assessing the desirability of states.

Q-Function (Q): The Q-function estimates the expected cumulative reward of taking a particular action in a given state and following a policy. It is closely related to the value function and helps the agent select actions.

Exploration vs. Exploitation: RL agents face a trade-off between exploration (trying new actions to learn more about the environment) and exploitation (choosing actions that are expected to yield the highest immediate rewards).

Learning Algorithms: RL uses various learning algorithms to update the agent's policy, value function, or Q-function based on observed experiences (state, action, reward) to improve decision-making.
